### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I am now a second year Ph.D. student in [THUIR](http://ai.thuir.cn/), Department of Computer Science and Technology in Tsinghua University (THU), Beijing, China. Before joining THU, I received the B.Eng.(2019) M.Eng.(2022) in South China University of Technology (SCUT) and Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS) respectively.
My supervisors are Prof. [Shaoping Ma](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~msp/), Prof. [Yiqun Liu](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/) and Prof. [Qingyao Ai](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~aiqy/).
